* Total Gastrectomy Roux-en-Y
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org477e33d
:END:

Created: 2025-05-03 - Updated: 2025-05-03

** Anatomy
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgd917e36
:END:

- Stomach's up high in your abdomen, just under the diaphragm, left of the midline.
- It's between the oesophagus and the duodenum.
- Made of five main regions:
  - Cardia - where food drops in from the oesophagus, just after the gastro-oesophageal junction.
  - Fundus - dome-shaped bit, sits above and left of the cardia.
  - Body - biggest section, under the fundus, next to the left diaphragm.
  - Antrum - lower part, holds partly digested food, gets it ready for the small intestine.
  - Pylorus - funnel-shaped, leads to the duodenum, has the pyloric sphincter (muscle that controls emptying).

*** Curveyyyyy  curves, sharpy angles, and loud neighbours
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org1540205
:END:

- Lesser curvature - short, inside curve, under the liver, has the incisura angularis (marks body-to-antrum change).
- Greater curvature - long, outside curve, runs from fundus to pylorus, attached to the greater omentum.
- Angle of His - sharp angle where oesophagus meets fundus.
- Lesser sac - space behind the stomach, in front of the pancreas, bordered by spleen, splenic artery, left kidney, and transverse mesocolon.

*** Layers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orge960d17
:END:

- Mucosa - innermost, where most stomach cancers start.
  - Has three bits:
  - Epithelium - with:
    - Surface mucous cells (make protective mucus)
    - Mucous neck cells (more mucus for lining)
    - Parietal cells (make hydrochloric acid & intrinsic factor for B12). Remember this... will become important later...
    - Chief cells (make pepsinogen for protein digestion)
    - Enteroendocrine cells (release hormones like gastrin, somatostatin, histamine)
  - Lamina propria - connective tissue
  - Muscularis mucosa - thin muscle layer
- Submucosa - support layer under mucosa.
- Muscularis propria - thick muscle, does the mixing and moving (peristalsis).
- Subserosa - connective tissue with blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves.
- Serosa - outer wrapping.
- When relaxed, mucosa and submucosa make folds called rugae.

*** Blood Supply
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgd7b7723
:END:

- Arteries:
  - Celiac trunk - main source, splits into left gastric, common hepatic, splenic arteries.
  - Common hepatic artery - gives off gastroduodenal artery (behind duodenum).
  - Left gastric artery - along top of lesser curvature, joins right gastric artery.
  - Right gastric artery - from proper hepatic, along bottom of lesser curvature, joins left gastric.
  - Left gastroepiploic artery - from splenic, along top of greater curvature, joins right gastroepiploic.
  - Right gastroepiploic artery - from gastroduodenal, along bottom of greater curvature, joins left gastroepiploic.
  - Short gastric arteries - 3-5 small ones from splenic/left gastroepiploic, go to fundus via gastrosplenic ligament.
- Veins:
  - Named same as arteries.
  - Right/left gastric veins drain to hepatic portal vein.
  - Short gastric and gastroepiploic veins drain to superior mesenteric vein.

*** Ligaments Holding the Stomach
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgba13e50
:END:

- Gastrocolic ligament - connects greater curvature to transverse colon, has gastroepiploic vessels.
- Gastrosplenic ligament - connects greater curvature to spleen, has left gastroepiploic & short gastric arteries.
- Gastrohepatic ligament - connects lesser curvature to liver, has right/left gastric arteries (sometimes left hepatic artery).
- Gastrophrenic ligament - connects top of stomach to left diaphragm.

*** Nerve Supply
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgd40bd5a
:END:

- Parasympathetic (vagus nerve) - boosts stomach activity, more juice and movement. Yum...
- Sympathetic (greater splanchnic nerve, T6-T9) - slows things down, less secretion and movement, constricts blood vessels.
- Enteric nervous system - local control, sorts out peristalsis, secretion, blood flow, all within the gut wall.
- Sensory nerves - send info about stretch, chemicals, and all that jazz, up to the braiiinzzz, help control appetite and reflexes (I feel as as though I have a broken sensory system, especially when I eat the salty delish belish seafood...).

** Surgical steps
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org04e8727
:END:

*** Patient Preparation and Positioning
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org73571c8
:END:

- General anaesthesia... obviously.
- The entire left side of the chest and abdomen is prepped.

*** Initial Incision
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org6373385
:END:

- A left thoracoabdominal incision is made, entering the pleural space through 7th intercostal space.
- The incision is extended across the costal arch and upper abdomen to the midline, ending halfway between the navel and xiphoid.
- The costal arch is divided with bone shears, and the cartilaginous arch is trimmed flush with the seventh and eighth ribs.
- The diaphragm is incised radially (8-10 cm), with diaphragmatic vessels sutured and ligated as they are divided.
- This allows the rib incision to be spread with a self-retaining retractor, exposing the distal oesophagus and left upper quadrant viscera.

*** Abdominal Exploration
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org9d3d4f4
:END:

- Before completing the incision, the abdomen is explored through the abdominal limb to assess resectability.
- If resection is not feasible, a palliative Celestin tube may be inserted.

*** Resective Phase
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org51fc9a6
:END:

- Mobilisation of the Spleen
  - The peritoneum lateral to the splenic hilus is incised, allowing the spleen and tail of the pancreas to be lifted off the perirenal fat.
- Interruption of Splenic Vessels
  - The splenic vessels are encircled by blunt dissection, clamped, divided, and double-ligated, leaving the spleen attached to the stomach by short gastric vessels.
- Disconnection of the Greater Omentum
  - The greater omentum is separated from the transverse colon, from hepatic to splenic flexure, by dividing the thin avascular connections.
- Ligation of Distal Gastric Blood Supply
  - The right gastric and right gastroepiploic vessels are interrupted and ligated.
- Disconnection Along the Lesser Curvature
  - The lesser omentum is incised; the upper, thicker part (gastrohepatic omentum) is clamped, divided, and ligated.
- Interruption of Left Gastric Vessels
  - The left gastric vessels, the final vascular connection to the stomach, are isolated and divided.
- Duodenal Transection
  - The duodenum is transected and closed with a TA 30 stapling device, with the staple line buried under interrupted seromuscular sutures.
- Mobilisation and Transection of the Distal Oesophagus
  - The left inferior pulmonary ligament is divided, allowing the lung to be retracted cephalad.
  - A Penrose drain is passed around the lower oesophagus and vagi, elevating them from the posterior mediastinum.
  - The distal oesophagus is encircled, dissected free, and, if necessary, a cuff of diaphragm is excised if there is neoplastic fixation.
  - A Foss clamp is applied 8-10 cm above the oesophagogastric junction, and the oesophagus is transected and closed with a stapling device.

*** Reconstruction Phase
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgff898a3
:END:

- Roux-en-Y Jejunal Limb Construction
  - An 18-inch (46-cm) Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum is constructed and anastomosed to the oesophagus to restore continuity.
  - The ligament of Treitz is identified, and a point 9 inches (23 cm) distal is marked for division.
  - The mesentery is transilluminated and incised radially, then divided at right angles to create a pedicle long enough to reach the chest.
- Jejunal Division and Passage
  - The jejunum is divided with a stapling device, and the staple line is reinforced with interrupted silk sutures.
  - A defect is created in the transverse mesocolon near the ligament of Treitz, allowing the jejunal limb to pass cephalad through the mesocolon and oesophageal hiatus to the divided oesophagus.
- Oesophagojejunostomy
  - The antimesenteric aspect of the jejunum is aligned with the oesophagus for an end-to-side anastomosis.
  - The anastomosis is performed with a posterior row of interrupted seromuscular sutures, followed by mucosal anastomosis.
- Jejunojejunostomy
  - To prevent reflux of biliary and pancreatic secretions, an end-to-side jejunojejunostomy is performed 18 inches (46 cm) distal to the oesophagojejunostomy.
  - All mesenteric defects are closed with sutures to prevent internal herniation.
- Drainage and Closure
  - A Levin tube is passed through the nose into the jejunum.
  - Two Penrose drains are placed: one from the duodenal stump, the other from the oesophagojejunostomy.
  - The mediastinal pleura is sutured closed over the lower oesophagus and upper jejunum.
  - The diaphragm and ribs are closed with heavy sutures, and a chest tube is placed.
  - The wounds are closed in layers, and a subcutaneous catheter is used to help prevent infection.

** Postoperative Care and Outcomes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org841cec9
:END:

*** Immediate Care
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org69412b6
:END:

- Postoperative care is similar to that after an Ivor-Lewis resection, except cimetidine is not required.
- Drains remain until the patient tolerates an oral diet and drainage is minimal.

*** Long-Term Considerations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org8d62e58
:END:

- The Roux-en-Y limb diverts duodenal contents, preventing reflux and providing a comfortable functional result.
- Early satiety is common but usually improves over time.
- Monthly parenteral vitamin B12 is required to prevent megaloblastic anaemia!!!!!!
- Approximately 90% of patients experience satisfactory swallowing and digestion postoperatively.

* Oesophagectomy
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org50a8e75
:END:

Created: 2025-04-28 - Updated: 2025-04-28

** The oOOOooOoOoOOooOOOooooOOoOesophagus
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgac0cd4a
:END:

- The oesophagus is a hollow, muscular tube lined by squamous epithelium.
- 25 cm long.
- It connects the hypopharynx to the stomach.
- Runs from the cricopharyngeal muscle (upper oesophageal sphincter) at C6 to about 2 cm below the diaphragm, where it joins the stomach.

*** Structure
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgabca939
:END:

- Has inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers. The upper third is striated muscle, the lower two-thirds is smooth muscle. The lower 4-6 cm forms the lower oesophageal sphincter with thickened smooth muscle.

*** Histology
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgd03136e
:END:

- Lined by stratified squamous epithelium, continuous with oral and pharyngeal mucosa. At the oesophagogastric junction, the lining abruptly changes to columnar epithelium at the "Z line." About one-third of people have small patches of columnar epithelium within the squamous lining.
- Submucosa contains scattered mucous glands secreting into the lumen.

*** Relations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org6f8c9ac
:END:

- In the thorax, the oesophagus is vertical and posterior, behind the trachea and heart, then deviates left behind the left bronchus and atrium. Indented by the aortic arch, crossed by the azygos vein, and parallels the descending aorta before passing through the diaphragm.
- Passes through the oesophageal hiatus, surrounded by diaphragmatic crura, and anchored by the phrenooesophageal ligament, with surrounding loose connective tissue.

*** Junction with Stomach
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org72c2d87
:END:

- Last 2 cm is intra-abdominal before joining the stomach at an acute angle (angle of His), marked by puckered gastric mucosa and a U-shaped gastric muscle sling.

*** Blood Supply
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org6c6be0c
:END:

- Receives segmental arterial supply from inferior thyroid, aorta, intercostal, tracheobronchial, and inferior phrenic arteries, plus submucosal gastric arteries.
- Venous drainage parallels arteries, mainly via azygos and hemiazygos veins.
- Submucosal veins connect portal and systemic systems.

*** Lymphatic Drainage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgd18a46a
:END:

- Lymphatics run longitudinally, draining to perioesophageal nodes in neck, mediastinum, and abdomen.

*** Innervation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org0c221ee
:END:

- Innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres (mainly vagus). Recurrent laryngeal nerves supply the upper sphincter and upper third. Vagal trunks run alongside, form a plexus in the middle third, then reunite as anterior and posterior trunks through the hiatus to the stomach.

** Cancer of the oesophagus
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgb0d2db7
:END:

- About half of oesophageal cancers are found at the oesophagogastric junction (OGJ).
- Most cancers at the cardia (around 90%) are adenocarcinomas. These usually start in the stomach lining and then extend up into the lower oesophagus, rather than being true oesophageal cancers.
- Exact causes are still unclear. There are some links to hiatal hernia, reflux oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, previous gastric surgery, or achalasia, but in many cases, the reason isn't obvious.
- Alcohol and tobacco use are common in affected patients.

*** Clinical Features
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org2e4088f
:END:

- Symptoms often don't appear until there's some blockage in the oesophagus.
- The most common sign is progressive difficulty swallowing - starting with solids and sometimes progressing to liquids. Painful swallowing (odynophagia) can also occur.
- Pain in the upper abdomen may be felt and can radiate to the back or around the ribs.
- This cancer can mimic other conditions such as achalasia, so early endoscopy and biopsy are important for anyone with new swallowing issues.
- Occasionally, it's picked up due to anaemia or gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Diagnosis isn't always straightforward; sometimes it's only confirmed during or after surgery.

*** Surgical Strategies
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org7dc6377
:END:

- Imaging and endoscopy usually provide the diagnosis and help define the extent of disease before surgery.
- Cancers are classified by location:
    1. Mainly oesophageal (supra Z-line)
    2. Centred at the OGJ (Z-line)
    3. Mainly gastric (infra Z-line)
    4. Extensive disease (rarely operable; may require total oesophagogastrectomy)
- Surgical goals are to remove the tumour, relieve obstruction, and maintain as much normal digestion as possible.
- The main operations are Ivor-Lewis oesophagogastrectomy and total gastrectomy with Roux-Y reconstruction.

*** Patient Selection
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org56eddf6
:END:

- Surgery is considered only if there's no evidence of distant spread (like to the liver, brain, lungs, or lymph nodes).
- CT scans aren't always reliable for determining if surgery is possible; direct exploration is often needed.
- If surgery isn't an option, a palliative oesophageal tube may help with swallowing.
- For tumours mainly in the stomach, where tubes aren't suitable, a gastrostomy or jejunostomy might allow patients to spend more time at home, though it doesn't improve swallowing or survival.
- Choosing an operation depends on tumour location, patient health, and other factors.

*** Prognosis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org2f28ec4
:END:

- Long-term survival is limited - about 20% reach five years after surgery, so most operations are sadly palliative.
- Surgical palliation can help restore swallowing, but if the operation isn't planned carefully, digestive problems can result.

** Modified Ivor-Lewis Esophagogastrectomy
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org2fe1dd7
:END:

- Used for cancers at or just above the Z-line (lower oesophagus and cardia).
- Two main phases:
  - Abdominal phase: Assess tumour, mobilise stomach, prepare for reconstruction.
  - Thoracic phase: Remove lower oesophagus and upper stomach, reconstruct.

*** Abdominal Phase (patient supine)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgfefdd76
:END:

- Incision: Upper midline, possibly extended upwards for better access.
- Expose left upper quadrant: Retract left costal arch, surgeon stands on patient's right.
  1) Divide triangular ligament of liver's left lobe, retract liver medially.
  2) Clamp, divide, ligate upper gastrohepatic omentum.
  3) Encircle distal oesophagus and vagi with [[https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/penrose-drain][Penrose drain]]; bluntly mobilise oesophagus, check tumour mobility and resectability.
  4) Mobilise stomach by dividing gastrocolic omentum outside gastroepiploic arcade, preserving right gastroepiploic vessels.
  5) Splenectomy (for distal oesophageal malignancy); control splenic vessels at hilum.
  6) Encircle splenic hilum, divide and ligate splenic vessels distal to pancreas tail.
  7) Divide short gastric vessels, free gastric fundus from diaphragm.
  8) Perform Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty (Weinberg modification) to aid gastric emptying post-vagotomy.

*** Thoracic Phase (patient left lateral, right thoracotomy)
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orge6e157e
:END:

- Incision: Right midthoracic, enter pleural space via 5th interspace.
- Expose oesophagus: Retract right lung, incise mediastinal pleura, leave strip attached to oesophagus.
- Mobilise oesophagus: Encircle with Penrose drain, mobilise with lymph nodes from posterior mediastinum.
- Transect oesophagus: Just below azygos vein (using non-crushing clamp and scalpel).
- Draw stomach into chest: Through oesophageal hiatus.
- Transect stomach: At least 4 cm from tumour, clamp and divide vessels of lesser and greater curvature.
- Tailor stomach: Staple lesser curvature, excise excess tissue, preserve right gastroepiploic vessels.
- Anastomosis: End-to-end between stomach and oesophagus; use silk sutures (horizontal on stomach, vertical on oesophagus), running lock stitch for mucosa, Maloney dilator to ensure lumen size.
- Secure stomach: Suture to mediastinal pleura to reduce tension.
- Insert NG tube.

*** Post-operative Care
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org1e3576d
:END:

- Straight after surgery, patients go to ICU.
- Urinary catheter stays in for 4-5 days.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics are given before and after surgery for about 4-5 days.
- We start parenteral (IV) nutrition the morning after surgery and keep it going until you can eat normally by mouth.
- Cimetidine is given intravenously until you're back on a regular diet, to protect the stomach lining.
- Dressings come off the day after surgery.
- Chest tubes (one on each side) are removed as soon as there's no more drainage or air leak. Sometimes they are kept in until the patient returns to full diet (to ensure that there is no chyle leak).
- Daily chest X-rays help us keep track of your recovery.
- By day 5 or 6, we look for signs bowel activity - if so, we do a Gastrografin swallow X-ray to check the join (anastomosis) for leaks and make sure everything's open.
- If there's no leak, you start with clear liquids by mouth, then move to a normal diet over the next 3 days. IV nutrition is gradually stopped.
- If a leak is found on the X-ray, feeding by mouth is stopped - we use a NG tube for stomach suction and continue IV nutrition (2,000-3,000 calories/day). Wait 2 weeks, then check again. If still leaking, IV nutrition continues for up to 3 weeks.
- Most patients are in hospital for 10-14 days if all goes well.
- Early satiety and weight loss are common after such operation, but eating small, frequent meals and drinking fluids between meals helps.
- Reflux isn't usually a problem because of the way the stomach is positioned, even though we don't do an anti-reflux procedure.
- Most people are back to normal activities about 6 weeks after surgery.
